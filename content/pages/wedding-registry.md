Summary: Wedding Registry


<p style="text-align: center;"> 

As we are blessed with material things, and all that living together brings.  
</br>
</br>  
Your presence as a guest, is all that we will request.
</br>
</br> 
Although if a gift is your intention, we thought that we would mention,  
</br>
</br>
What we would really like for our special day, is to top it off with a holiday!  
</br>
</br> 
We’d love some pennies to put together, for memories that we will always treasure.  
</br>
</br>  
Or if you’d rather, it would also mean a lot for a contribution towards our little plot,  
</br>
</br>
We would love to turn our garden into a communal space, for our friends and family to visit us in our tranquil place.  
</br>

We would like to thank you all for being a part of our special day, and will keep you posted of our adventures along the way.
